            <h3>Analysis of Car Listing in the Kenyan Market</h3>
            <p>This project involves scraping and analyzing car listings from Jiji.co.ke, one of Kenya's most popular online marketplaces. Using Selenium, we collected detailed car data, stored it in a PostgreSQL database, and used SQL and Python for data analysis and visualization. The goal is to gain actionable insights for car buyers and sellers and understand trends in the used and new car markets in Kenya.</p>

            <h3>Customer Support Chatbot</h3>
            <p>This chatbot answers questions about products and FAQs using CSV data and a large language model (LLM). It reads product details from products.csv (name, category, price, stock, features) and FAQ pairs from faqs.csv (question, answer). The chatbot uses the Ollama LLM with the deepseek-r1:1.5b model, embedding model and langchain to understand and respond to queries.</p>
